## How to basic

How Claude Code should work in this repository. These rules are universal and
apply before any project-specific guidance below.

### Philosophy

**Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.**

1. **Think before coding.** Don't assume, don't hide confusion, surface
   tradeoffs. State your assumptions explicitly and ask when uncertain. If
   multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of silently picking one.
   If something is unclear, stop and name what's confusing.

2. **Simplicity first.** Write the minimum code that solves the problem, nothing
   speculative. No features beyond what was asked, no abstractions for single-use
   code, no configurability that wasn't requested, no error handling for
   impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it. Ask: "Would a
   senior engineer call this overcomplicated?"

3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what you must; clean up only your own mess.
   Don't improve adjacent code, don't refactor what isn't broken, and match the
   existing style even if you'd do it differently. Remove only the
   imports/variables/functions your own changes made unused; mention unrelated
   dead code rather than deleting it. Every changed line should trace directly to
   the request.

4. **Goal-driven execution.** Define success criteria, then loop until verified.
   Turn vague tasks into testable goals ("fix the bug" → "write a test that
   reproduces it, then make it pass"). For multi-step work, state a brief plan
   with a verification check per step. Strong success criteria let you iterate
   independently; weak ones ("make it work") force constant clarification.

### Technical principles

How Claude should write code, design, and structure the project.

#### Universal – every codebase

- **Names say what they mean.** Clear, descriptive names over clever or
  abbreviated ones. Match the conventions already in use.
- **Comments explain why, not what.** Match the surrounding comment density.
  Don't narrate code that speaks for itself; don't leave commented-out blocks.
- **Dependencies are a cost.** Prefer the standard library and existing
  dependencies. Ask before adding a new one.
- **Errors that can actually happen.** Handle realistic failure modes; don't
  guard against the impossible.
- **Never hardcode secrets.** No credentials, tokens, or keys in source or logs.
- **Frame every code file with blank lines.** Start and end each programming
  file with one empty line (not data files like `.csv`).
- **Verify your work.** Run the tests, linters, or the app itself before
  claiming something is done. Report failures honestly.
- **Reference code precisely.** Point to `file:line` so claims can be checked.
- **No em-dashes.** When writing prose, use a hyphen (-) or en-dash (–), never
  an em-dash (—).

#### New codebase (Python)

Apply when starting fresh, with no existing conventions to follow.

- **Naming.** `snake_case` for functions, variables, and modules; `PascalCase`
  for classes (e.g. Pydantic models and `Enum` classes); `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for
  module-level constants (e.g. the dropdown lists in `form_templates/lists/`).
- **Docstrings.** Google style for modules and public functions. Private
  functions take a one-line docstring and a `_` name prefix.
- **Explicit imports.** No `from X import *`.
- **Two blank lines** between top-level function and class definitions (one
  blank line between methods), per PEP 8.
- **Early returns over deep nesting** – especially in node functions.
- **Fix typos at the source.** When you touch a symbol with a typo, rename it
  rather than propagate the mistake.
- **Line length.** Limit code lines to 79 characters. For flowing prose
  (docstrings, comments), limit to 72 characters.

#### Existing codebase

Apply when conventions are already established.

- **Match the codebase.** Follow the existing structure, naming, idioms, and
  formatting, even where they differ from the "New codebase" rules above.
  Consistency with the surrounding code beats personal preference.
- **When the conventions are unclear or inconsistent, ask** whether to apply the
  "New codebase" rules instead.

## Project

Project-specific guidance. The "### Overview" below is mandatory and written for
humans. Add detail inside it, and append any further sections (commands, stack,
structure, conventions, current state, …) after it.

### Overview

<!-- Required. In plain language a human can follow: What is this project? What
     does it do, and for whom? Replace this comment with that description. -->
